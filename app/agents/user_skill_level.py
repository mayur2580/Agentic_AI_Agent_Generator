Consider these factors:
1. Technical terminology used
2. Complexity of requirements
3. Specificity of implementation details
4. Expected sophistication of solution
 
Classify as:
- BEGINNER: Simple, non-technical language, general requests, minimal technical details
- INTERMEDIATE: Some technical aspects, specific functional needs, basic implementation details
- ADVANCED: Precise technical terms, complex requirements, detailed implementation specifics
